Welcome to Starbound Modding Guide ( Formerly known as Starbound Modding Unoffical EBook ) 
In order to create a more indepth guide more accessible to everyone I decided to move away from PDF files and move the book to its own Github page

The Reason being it allows you more easier access to the files and allows you directly to copy and paste code to test for your self.
